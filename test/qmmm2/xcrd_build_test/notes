These tests check that the routines that build the
coordinate array for the QM region (MM) and the 
qm_mm pair list are working correctly for different
types of periodic boxes.

1) orthorhombic_no_ewald
2) trunc_oct_no_ewald

These two tests are for NMA in the same water box. The only difference
is that for the truncated octahedron case the box size has been modified.
Since there is no qm_ewald in use the escf on step 0 should be the same for both
these tests.

3) oct_nma_imaged
4) oct_nma_noimage

These two tests are 5 steps of QMMM MD take from a restart file after 11ns of classical
MD. As such many waters plus the QM region itself have diffused out of the central box.
The noimage run is a straight run from this restart. The imaged run uses an inpcrd file
that was imaged using ptraj. The should of course give identical answers.
